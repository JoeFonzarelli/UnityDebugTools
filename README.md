# Welcome to the Unity Debug Tools!

this project includes the core of the Unity Debug Tools I use for quick debugging and testing while I develop my Unity games. It may look
simple and basic, but it helped me many times finding easy debugging functionalities in order to quickly detect bugs and gave me the 
opportunity to change the game settings easily without the need of an extensive in-game option menu.

##What does this tool offer?

The main element of the debugger is the HUD_DEBUG prefab. from which we have access both to the console and the quick buttons menu.
Just drag the prefab in any scene and it's ready to use. We can see the built in commands in ***Assets/scripts/DeveloperTools/ConsoleCommands***.

We also have a hud print tool that allows us to print messages on screen from any part of our code, offering a visual solution similar to the
prints used in Unreal Engine.
